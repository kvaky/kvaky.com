“Peter, you should visit me in Greece, we will climb Mt. Olympus,” Giorgos proposed to me.<br>
“Sure, I can hitchhike there, why not?” I replied.
It was winter in Bratislava and at that moment, we were both high on dopamine from swimming in the cold Danube.<!--more--> The plan sounded like a plan that’s forgotten within 5 minutes, but I kept my word. It was going to be simple: Hitchhike to Katerini (where Giorgos lives), climb Olympus, hitchhike to Athens, fly home. Four months later, in June, I departed from Bratislava on a journey I would not forget.
I spent the first two days riding from gas pump to gas pump, hanging out with truck drivers at border crossings. I would walk across fields and climb over fences to reach rest stops on highways. I slept at the most random places like a pile of closets—as a naïve protection against animals. ***You know, hitchhiking***. I will not get into details of hitchhiking and light traveling, but if you are interested in that, you can subscribe to this blog at the bottom of the page.

*Overview of the route*

Approaching Greece, a mountain range made of a single ridge at the border called Belasica caught my attention. I had a lot of spare time, sleeping bag with me, so I decided to sleep on top of the highest peak there, called Radomir. It was already afternoon and the ascent awaiting me was going to be demanding given that I was tired as fuck from non-stop traveling. I spent most of the route up in a warm and humid forest with flies whooshing right into my eyes ***and I saw tortoises mating***. When I reached the top after climbing 1800 vertical meters, I was done. The sun had just set, coloring the sky dark red.

After I found a leeward place, I forced myself to eat a bit of sandwich and slipped into sleeping bag. The ridge was covered by soft grass which is perfect to sleep on. Laying there, looking at cloudless sky with first stars visible, I felt content but weird. The demanding uphill and tiredness from preceding days resulted in my mind being an uncontrolled stream of the most random words that made zero sense. 

*I can say I was kinda tripping, not in a pleasant way.*

Luckily, it didn’t take long until I lost consciousness. When I woke up, the sun was already well above the horizon. Since going down the same way is boring, I traversed the ridge 5 km towards east and started a descent by a path I saw on a map. The descent was steep, with frequent bushes reaching up to knees. I did appreciate the protective layer of hair on my legs. ***The route was not in alignment with my expectations***. After having descended 200 vertical metres, I realized this might have not been the best idea. Meanwhile, my phone died because I forgot my external battery at a truckdriver the day before. The further I descended, the less I could follow the path. At one point, being just above the forest level, I realized I definitely lost the path. I had around 2 dl of water left.
