“Peter, you should visit me in Greece, we will climb Mt. Olympus,” Giorgos proposed to me.<br>
“Sure, I can hitchhike there, why not?” I replied.

It was winter in Bratislava and at that moment, we were both high on dopamine from swimming in the cold Danube. <!--more--> The plan sounded like one that’s forgotten within 5 minutes, but I kept my word. Four months later, in June, I departed from Bratislava on a journey I would not forget.
It was going to be simple: Hitchhike to Katerini (where Giorgos lives), climb Olympus, hitchhike to Athens, fly home. First three days consisted of:

* Riding from gas pump to gas pump,
* Hanging out with truck drivers at border crossings,
* Walking across fields,
* Climbing over fences to reach rest stops on highways,
* Sleeping at the most random places like a pile of closets—as a naïve protection against animals.

You know, hitchhiking. I will not get into details of how I travel in this post, but if you are interested in that, you can subscribe to this blog at the bottom of the page and I might write a post about how to travel adventurously (light and cheap).

*Overview of the route*

Approaching Greece from Bulgaria, a mountain range made of a single ridge at the border called Belasica caught my attention. I had a lot of spare time and a sleeping bag with me, so I decided to sleep at the top of the highest peak there, called Radomir. It was already afternoon and the ascent awaiting me was going to be demanding given that I was tired as fuck from non-stop traveling.

I spent most of the route up in a warm and humid forest with flies whooshing right into my eyes, ***and I saw tortoises mating***. When I reached the top after climbing 1800 vertical meters, I was done. The sun had just set, coloring the sky dark red. *”Everything was so quiet, as if the silence was listening”*. After I found a leeward place, I forced myself to eat a bit of a sandwich and slipped into my sleeping bag. The ridge was covered by soft grass, which was perfect to sleep on. Laying there, looking at the cloudless sky with first stars visible, I felt content but weird. The demanding uphill and tiredness from preceding days resulted in my mind being an uncontrolled stream of the most random words that made zero sense.

*I can say I was kinda tripping, not pleasantly.*

Luckily, it didn’t take long until I lost consciousness. When I woke up, the sun was already well above the horizon. Since going down the same way as up is boring, I traversed the ridge 5 km east and started a descent by a path I saw on a map. It was steep and hard to follow, with frequent bushes reaching up to knees. I appreciated the protective layer of hair on my legs. ***The route was not in alignment with my expectations***. After having descended 200 vertical meters, I realized this might have not been the best idea. Meanwhile, my phone died because I forgot my external battery in a truck the day before. The further I descended, the less I could follow the path. At one point, being just above the forest level, I realized I definitely lost the path. I had around 2 dl of water left and my legs were already tired. Being sunny June in Greece, looking at the forest between me and the houses more than a (vertical) kilometer below, it didn’t look good. It actually looked quite bad.

I remembered the stories of people who died from dehydration and realized it was probably also my case. I got scared for my life. I thought about how my closest people would feel if I never returned. It sucks being confronted with the fact that you might die way sooner than you thought. I stood there for a few seconds absorbing the situation I was in. The survival instinct kicked in. I hope I will never be as high on adrenaline as I was then.

I had two options:

1. Return up, traverse the ridge and descend by the route I came up.
1. Continue down and hope for the best.

Both options were shitty. As the sun burnt hotter, I thought I would not make it all the way up and back. I might have been delusional, but I thought that by the “V” shape of the valley, there should be a spring of water somewhere under me, so I chose the second option. I emptied my backpack and brought only light/essential things with me: headlamp, empty bottle, phone, passport, and wallet. I filled my pockets and left the backpack with everything else behind. When I entered the forest, the slope was steep, letting me sit on the fallen leaves and slide down some parts of the hill. What continued was just a numb, careful descent until I saw something shiny 100 meters down from me. *Was it water? You bet!*

I have no idea how long it took me to find it. I don’t think the *objective time*: minutes and hours makes sense when experiencing something we are not used to. In these situations, time expands and contracts arbitrarily. When I got to the spring and took the first sips, everything was perfect. It was the happiest moment of my life. I drank as much as I needed and filled my bottle. I decided not to return for my backpack because I had just saved myself and screw it; I was still lost and I just wanted to get down. I walked down next to the spring. The spring gradually gained size and from one point, it became easier to just walk inside it with water reaching up to my knees. I encountered a few minor waterfalls that I was confident I could climb around. At one point though, there was a waterfall that was so big that I couldn’t climb around without risk of falling and getting injured. I had to traverse to the closest trees and climb down by grabbing their roots. The only issue was that the ground was full of ants that bit my fingers when trying to grab onto roots, which was inconvenient but no show stopper.

The lower I descended, the more beautiful the environment got. Different kinds of flying insects and birds chirping kept me company. I noticed a logging road, so I followed it down. After getting out of the spring and finally gaining some speed, I realized my feet are not big friends with walking in wet €10 shoes from decathlon. I felt some nasty blisters developing and finally understood why some people get black toenails. Mine eventually fell off. Every time I encountered another road, I tried to guess which would get me down the fastest. Looking at my path, you can say I didn’t guess that well, but I walked only around twice the optimal distance which wasn’t that bad.

*My route is marked with red*

Eventually, I made it to a small town called Vyronia where I found a restaurant. I ordered some chicken with potatoes, barely ate it because my body was still in the “fight-or-flight” state. The waitress noticed that I am not 100% okay, so she asked me what happened. It was hard but funny explaining it to her in German, as I hadn’t spoken it since I left high school, which had been already ~4 years. When I told her I wanted to get to Thessaloniki that day, she offered me a ride to the highway after she would finish her shift in half an hour. I charged my phone and we departed. We arrived at the highway by a road few cars use. The highway was busy, but there was no way I could stop the cars there.

*Getting to Thessaloniki wasn’t straightforward*

What made things worse (but funnier) was that after one hour of me waiting, out of nowhere, a group of three Pakistani guys appeared. When we started talking, it turned out that they were also hitchhiking to Thessaloniki. I asked them if I could hitch a car alone first because there was no way somebody would stop at a group of 4 people. They agreed. As I was waiting, I saw a car on a bridge approaching. It was a police car. The situation reached peak hilarity. The two policemen asked me with no backpack, dirty from mud and three Pakistani guys what we were doing there, how we got there, and where we were going. After we replied, one policeman started talking with one Pakistani guy in Greek and it seemed they had some trouble. I asked the other policeman if they could take me to the closest gas pump on the highway. He told me they were going to the Bulgarian border. I said that’s great, I could catch a car from there. So that was the first time I hitchhiked a police car. At the border, it didn’t take too much time to find someone going directly to Thessaloniki. It was a Serbian woman returning from a shooting competition in the Czech Republic.

I successfully made it to Thessaloniki where I met my friends Giorgos and Radek with whom we climbed Mt. Olympus two days later, but that is a different story.

*Since that day, I take nothing for granted and am thankful for each day I get to live.*
